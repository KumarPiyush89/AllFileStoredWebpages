    <p>Maulana Mazharul Haque (1866-1930) born in a privileged family was sent to England to study law. When he finished his law degree he came back to practice law in India. His profession gave him the opportunity to understand the overwhelming problem facing the public. This drew him closer to Mahatma Gandhi and he joined the freedom struggle to make India an independent nation.

        <br/>Mazharul Haque was a legal luminary, a statesman, an educationist, a journalist, a poet and a philosopher combined in one. A staunch nationalist and a firm believer in secular foundations of this country he believed that "whether we are Hindus or Mussalmans we are in the same boat. We must sail or sink together."
        
        <br/>A pillar of nation building he advocated free primary education to all. For developing higher education and strengthening freedom movement he founded Sadaquat Ashram and Bihar Vidyapeeth. His magnanimity of donating his properties and wealth to the national cause earned him the title of 'Deshbhushan' and 'Fakir' from the contemporary national leaders. He vigorously supported the Elementary Education Bill (1911) in pre-independent India as he believed that, it was "so far-reaching in its effects that it will effect a profound change in the destiny of our motherland."
        
        <br/>Maulana Mazharul Haque breathed his last after a brief illness on 2nd January, 1930. Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his message of condolence that "Mazharul Haque was a great patriot, a good Mussalman and a philosopher ……….such a man would be missed at all times, he will be the more missed at this juncture in the history of the country."
        
        Tributes

        <br/>"Mazharul Haque was a great patriot, a good Musalman and a philosopher …………..such a man would be missed at all times, he will be more missed at this juncture in the history of the country."
        (Mahtma Gandhi)
        
        <br/>"In the early days of non-cooperation he (Mazharul Haque) played an important part in our great movement and was one of its chosen leaders. It is right that we houour his memory and pay our tribute to him."
        (Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru)
        
        <br/>………the recognition to be so accorded to this great patriot assumes significance today when all our efforts are bent on creating a society free of all biases of religion and sectarianism. Maulana Mazharul Haque was a distinguished nationalist Muslim.
        (S.Radhakrishnan)
        
        <br/>"………….Maulana Mazharul Haque will always be remembered as a selfless worker and a patriot who made his mark during Non-Cooperation Movement."
        (Lal Bahadur Shastri)
        <br/><br/>
        The purity of his nationalism was only excelled by the saintliness which attracted public attention and endeared him to the people of India in general and to the people of Bihar in particular ………."
        (Pattabhi Sitaramayya)
        <br/><br/>
        "……..He lives like a Fakir, is a man of iron will and actions, he retains the confidence of Muslims and Hindus of Bihar………….."
        (B.F. Bharucha)</p>
