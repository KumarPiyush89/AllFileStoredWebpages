            <p>MAULANA MAZHARUL HAQUE born in a privileged family 
                was sent to England to study law. When he finished his law degree he came back to practice law in India. His Profession 
                gave him the opportunity to understand the overwhelming problem facing the Indian public under British Rule. This drew him 
                closer to Mahatma Gandhi and he joined the freedom struggle to make Indian independent nation. He was a legal luminary, a statesman, an educationa
                list, a journalist, a poet and a philosopher combined in one. A staunch nationalist and a firm believer in secular foundations
                 of this country he believed that "whether we are Hindus or
                  Mussalmans we are in the same boat. We must sail or sink together." <br/><img class="fagu" src="Sri_Phagu_Chauhan.jpg"/></p>

                Season's Greetings from Maulana Mazhrul Haque Arabic & Persian Uni<br/><br/>
                versity, Patna. The University has a distinct identity. Besides serving the needs of Madrasa syst<br/><br/>
                em of higher education, conducting Alimâ€”Fazil examinations, the University has come to stamp its name in the <br/><br/>
                mainstream education, caring to the needs of lacs of students from the downtrodden, marginalised & extremely poor and backward section of society, and also women, particularly muslim women who had been particularly hesitant to join the mainstream education under adverse economic scenario or social taboo. It is a renaissance in a new avtar, with University's vision and mission spreading far and wide stretched to the 38 districts of the state, imparting higher education in regular mode, in contrast to distance mode of education, improving GER of the State.<br/><br/>
                I extend my thanks to all the staff and officers of the University, hon'ble members of the Statutory Bodies including Syndicate and Senate, at the dawn of a new year and an era unfolding universal messages of devotion, education and human values which in turn reflect the principles of tolerance, peace, brotherhood and prosperity.<br/><br/>
